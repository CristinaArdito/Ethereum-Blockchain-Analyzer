# Ethereum Blockchain Analyzer

This is a project to analyze all the smart contracts in the Ethereum Blockchain. It uses Etherscan, a Block Explorer, to access and scan all the contracts in the Blockchain in order to retrieve useful information not available on a local node. 
It can be used to analyse the opcodes generated by compiling the smart contracts and to verify  which Solidity compiler it is used to generate the Ethereum bytecode.

It includes an analyzer of the Solidity compiler to understand which opcodes are used in each version of the compiler.
